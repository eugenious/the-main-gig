_Two developers looking at code together._

Done right, pair programming is the best way to code. Done wrong, it becomes the worst. There is a vast wealth of resources on pair pgramming, so if it's something you're not too familiar with, you're in for a real treat. More than any other main gig practice, it will take your and your team's skills to another level. We'll give only some brief general comments about it in this guide.

Why isn't pair programming more widespread than it is? Because it is hard. It takes a certain chemistry within the team to be able to collaborate so closely together. Once you achieve this level of collaboration, however, you will never want to work any other way!

When you do pair programming, you have nowhere to hide. So you need to be mature enough, comfortable enough, and humble enough to reveal your thought processes to each other. And because programming itself is hard, a good percentage of your thoughts are going to be along the lines of: I have no idea what's going on here. It takes a great deal of trust, and willingness to be vulnerable, to pair well.

There are many different variations on pair programming. You are highly encouraged to try several of them. Don't expect to be good at pairing right away. Practice, practice, practice! You'll get better at it, we promise.
