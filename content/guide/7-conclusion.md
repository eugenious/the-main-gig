It is dangerous to think that one must choose between quality and speed. From a raw output perspective, you might be able to sacrifice quality to deliver a feature or two faster in the short term, but having to deal with complicated, confusing and buggy code is a guaranteed way to sabotage a team's ability to deliver the next feature and the one after that. There's even a term for that: project heat death. The choice, really, is between having both quality and speed, or having neither quality nor speed.

The main gig practices help to protect against poor code quality. A technical consultation before diving into the coding helps to avoid missed or misunderstood requirements and poor implementation strategies. The ideal coding sequence provides a framework for the often chaotic and sometimes mysterious process of code creation, keeping us disciplined and on track. Pair programming is code review all the time, so those confusing, sub-optimal lines of code don't stand a chance and get weeded out right away. A code walkthrough lets the developer talk about what was done, in preparation for the code review, a final validation that everything was done correctly.

The main gig practices allow issues to be identified and resolved earlier, rather than later. Fixing problems (such as missed requirements, misunderstood requirements, edge cases, buggy code) early requires less effort than fixing them later. Code rework is inefficient, unpleasant, and difficult. It's much better to avoid code rework altogether.

Great software comes from great teams. The main gig practices will help you develop your developers, write quality software, write that software quickly, and delight your customers!

## A Personal Note

I've been blessed in my career to have had many software jobs and many excellent software mentors, starting from my very first co-op workterm, when I thought four months was such a long time and I learned vi and felt so accomplished. I've worked with countless colleagues who taught me so much about the art of writing software, and gave so generously of their time. I've been at this gig for over two decades now, and writing this guide is one small way for me to give back to the larger software development community.

I want to say something which may seem so obvious that it should go without saying: You have to care. If you don't care about your craft, about getting better at it every day, you are in the wrong job. Writing code can be great fun, very rewarding, and a fulfilling career, but it's not for everybody. Even within the software industry there are many "non-coding" jobs which can lead to wonderful and rewarding careers. 

For those of you who continue to choose the way of the code, may this guide help you along your journey. Care about your craft. Learn all you can, and teach all you can. Be good to each other.
