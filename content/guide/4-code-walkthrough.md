_Share what you did with your reviewers at the start of the code review._

Talking about your code is a skill which most people need to learn. There are few developers who are naturally good at explaining what they did, how they did it, and why they chose to do it that way. But as with most things, you get better at it through intentional practice.

The code walkthrough is a developer's first opportunity to talk about the finished solution. On Agile teams, other opportunites are at the end of sprint stakeholder demo, and, on some teams, at a team's internal demo.

By the time you are at the code walkthrough stage, it is expected that all issues have been sorted out, and your work has been prepared for code review. It can be thought of as the first step of a code review, but we prefer to call it out as a separate practice to highlight its significance. Depending on how much collaboration has already taken place before the code review stage, the code walkthrough might not be necessary. It is a code reviewer's right, but not obligation, to ask for a code walkthrough.

The practice of a code walkthrough isn't too well known, but we advocate it for the following benefits:

- it helps reviewers understand the context of the work
- it draws attention to noteworthy implementation details
- it provides a first opportunity for reviewers to ask questions

Generally speaking, a code walkthrough is NOT a line-by-line review of the code. That is reserved for the code review proper.
