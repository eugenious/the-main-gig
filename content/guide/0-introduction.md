On my current software development team, we have the concept of "side gigs", where developers volunteer to become the team's subject matter expert on a particular technology or aspect of the software development lifecycle. The idea that gave birth to this guide was the thought that if becoming an expert on end-to-end testing, or continuous integration, or application logging are side gigs, then what's the "main gig"? 

As software developers, we often spend large parts of our workday doing everything but writing code. We attend meetings, write requirements, prioritize features, plan roadmaps, prepare software for release, investigate defects, design systems, interpret specs, read documentation, write documentation, learn new technologies, teach others about new technologies, and so on. Not that these activities are unimportant (and indeed, a well-rounded developer should strive to be good at all of them), but in the end, the point of software development is simple: to write working software.

The Main Gig is a guide to the art of writing software. Software development is a popular profession, flooded with many eager and young minds. But there is also a very significant learning curve, which goes way beyond learning the syntax of a language and calling it a day. If you have learned to spell, does that mean you can write a book? Learning a computer language and learning to code are completely different endeavours. So, how do we get better at writing code? That's the topic of this guide.

The purpose of this guide is not to reveal new and earth-shattering ideas, but rather to express clearly a set of recommended practices which have been found to be useful in the day-to-day work of software development teams. You are most likely already familiar with many of these practices. So why bother to write about things which software developers already know and do? Sometimes a clear articulation of basic ideas goes a long way towards understanding what you might have been practicing by instinct and common sense. On the other hand, if we've learned anything about common sense, it's that it's not nearly as common as one might have thought it would be.

This guide is written for coders. Whether you are just starting out as a developer, or just starting out as a tech lead, or somewhere in between, may you find something here to encourage and motivate you in your career.

## The Goals

The premise for this guide is that to be able to write good and fast code, you need good and fast coders. So we need to focus on the skills of the developer individually, and of the development team collectively. We all start as novices, but with the right attitudes and practices in place on our teams, we can learn to become really good at our craft.

Writing software has not always been a team activity. Not so long ago, say around the year 2000, writing software was a much more individual activity. Code reviews, if they were done at all, were a bit like an interrogation ("Why did you write the code like that? It's wrong!"). Many practices we consider standard today were considered "extreme", and codified in the ideas of "Extreme Programming", one of the first Agile methodologies before Scrum became ubiquitous. Test driven development was new, and git didn't even exist!

What we are trying to achieve is a successful software development team, and we define success as:

* GOOD: maintaining a high-quality code base
* FAST: delivering new code efficiently
* IMPROVING: collaborating and learning from each other

## Summary of the Practices

Let's get started! If this guide has one overarching idea, it would be this: We should treat every interaction between developers as an opportunity to learn and grow.

All the practices stem from this one powerful idea.

Here are the practices:

1. **The technical consultation**: Have a chat with one or two other developers about the task before starting to code.
2. **The ideal coding sequence**: What happens in a perfect situation.
3. **Pair programming**: Two developers looking at code together.
4. **Code walkthrough**: Share what you did with your reviewers at the start of the code review.
5. **Code review**: Make sure all the ducks are lined up in a row.

Applying these practices consistently and systematically, day in and day out, is how you build successful software. It is also how you build a team of developers who are always learning from each other and getting better at their craft.

If at this point, you are thinking I know these things already, and my team is already doing these things, then congratulations, you are part of a high-functioning team! This guide is targeted at teams at the other end, at teams who might be struggling with code quality issues, or high turnover, or slow delivery, or too many inexperienced developers.
