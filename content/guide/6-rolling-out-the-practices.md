title: "Rolling Out the Practices"

The best approach to rolling out the practices is to let the team decide and agree on what should be done. It's not all or nothing, but an evolution towards a desired target state. Nor do all practices need to be strictly enforced, but some of them could be agreed to as being optional.

We've done our best to describe the desired attitudes and mindsets to be nurtured in a developer. Certainly there are many more, such as selfless teamwork, leading by example, a curiosity to dig deeper and be constantly learning, knowledge sharing not knowledge hoarding, keeping team documentation accurate and accessible, taking your work seriously but not taking yourself too seriously.

Aim for perfection, but don't fret it when your team falls short of it.

The main questions to ask are:
* Are we becoming better coders?
* Is our codebase getting better with each change?
* Are we heading in the right direction?
